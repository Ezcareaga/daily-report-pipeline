```

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ezcareaga/daily-report-pipeline.git
cd daily-report-pipeline
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. Copy example config:
```bash
cp config/config.example.ini config/config.ini
```

2. Update with your credentials:
```ini
[DATABASE]
host = your_oracle_host
port = 1521
user = your_user
password = your_password

[EMAIL]
habilitado = true
servidor_smtp = smtp.gmail.com
puerto_smtp = 587
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from datetime import datetime
from src.core.config import ConfigManager
from src.core.database import DatabaseManager
from src.core.email import EmailManager
from src.core.excel import ExcelGenerator
from src.reports.processor import ReportProcessor

# Initialize components
config = ConfigManager("config/config.ini")
excel = ExcelGenerator(config)
email = EmailManager(config)

with DatabaseManager(config) as db:
    processor = ReportProcessor(config, db, email, excel)
    
    # Generate report
    result = processor.process(
        date=datetime.now(),
        output_path=Path("output/report.xlsx"),
        headers=['ID', 'Name', 'Amount']
    )
    
    print(f"Processed {result.records_processed} records")
```

## Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_processor.py -v
```
## Development Scripts

### Using Make (Linux/Mac)
```bash
make install-dev  # Install all dependencies
make test         # Run tests
make demo         # Run demo
```

### Using Python scripts (Cross-platform)
```bash
python scripts/dev.py install-dev
python scripts/dev.py test
python scripts/dev.py demo
```

### Manual commands
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
python demo/demo_report.py
```

This is a personal portfolio project, but feedback is welcome! Feel free to open an issue.

## About This Project

This system was developed as a personal initiative to automate manual reporting processes at my current workplace. What previously took hours of manual work now runs automatically, reducing processing time by 90% and eliminating human errors.

The codebase has been refactored and generalized for portfolio purposes, removing any company-specific information while maintaining the professional architecture and best practices.

### Real-World Impact
- ⏱Processing time: 2 hours → 10 minutes
- Error rate: ~5% → 0%
- Frequency: Daily automated execution
- Users: Finance and operations teams
